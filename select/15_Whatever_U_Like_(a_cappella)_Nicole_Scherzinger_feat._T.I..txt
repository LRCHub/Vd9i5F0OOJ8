All at a dime

Drop like a helicop
Pay attention on me
While I show you the scenario

You're charming me boy
You boy, you're charming me
Just like this beat is gonna do
On the radio

Damn, I thought you knew me
By way you're talking to me
You get any closer to me
Then I might just have to let it go

Something 'bout that cocky thing
You got me wanna see what's really going on

Eat it, beat it, till it's swollen
You gonna need an icepack

I'll tell her big thang poppin'
Let me hear you say that
Lay back, play that
Purp Kush blowing in the Maybach

With my company
Three and them be one of me
Imagine what they done to me
On top of me, up under me

Accept no imitation, baby
Other cat be hatin'
They be all in ya face

Or we can ball in the A

Wait a minute, motherfucker

I've been looking all night
Wanna kiss it one time
Mommy do what you like
Go head pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it

First you gotta get right
I can love you long time
I become a big crime
Then I'll pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it

Once she wind it uptight
I promise a goodnight
Girl, you're gonna sleep tight
When I pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it

Wanna look at your eyes
When you get the big prize
Gonna give it up kind
When I pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it
