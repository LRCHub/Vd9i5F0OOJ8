I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues
if I want
I'm free to say whatever I
Whatever I like
If it's wrong or right
it's all right
It always seems to me
You always see
What people want you to see
How long's it gonna be
Before we get on the bus
And cause no fuss
Get a grip of yourself
It don't cost much
You're free to be whatever you
Whatever you say
If it comes my way
it's all right
You're free to be wherever you
Wherever you please
You can shoot
the breeze if you want
It always seems to me
You always see
What people want you to see
How long's it gonna be
Before we get on the bus
And cause no fuss
Get a grip of yourself
Here in my mind
I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues
if I want
Here in my mind
You know you might find
Something that you
You thought you once knew
But now it's all gone
And you know it's no fun
Yeah I  know it's no fun
Oh I know it's no fun
I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues
if I want
I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues
if I want
Whatever you do
Whatever you say
Yeah you know it's all right
Whatever you do
Whatever you say
Yeah I know it's all right
